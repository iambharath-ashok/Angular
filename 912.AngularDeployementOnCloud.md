#	Deployment of Angular Application

-	Use AWS S3 for static web hosting 
-	Angular deployment is all about uploading all the angular trans-piled files and return index.hmtl files
-	Angular application can also be deployed in Firebase application


## Hosting Angular application with AWS s3

-	Create a bucket and upload all the angular files
-	Go to properties and click on static web hosting 
-	Select use this bucket to host a website
-	Give index.html as the starting page  and also as error page
-	Set up the right policy 
-	that's it we can start using the angular application


##	Optimization techniques


-	minificaition
-	uglyfication
-	Bundling
	-	combining multiple js files into single file
	-	using bundle client can large portion of code at single request
	-	client dont needs to make multiple requests to get the different files
	-	Application loads fast
-	Dead code elimination
-	Ahead of Time compilation
	-	pre-compiling angular components and templates
	
	
	
##	JIT vs AOT

-	JIT:
	-	JIT compilation is runtime compilation
	-	JIT is used for dev env

-	AOT

	-	Faster start up 
	-	Smaller bundle size as there will be no angular compiler with vendor.bundle.js file
	-	Better security



## Linting

-	Linter is program that can be configured  with various rules and then it performs a static analysis of our code to check if we have violated the rules
-	angular application by default as tslint dependencies defined in package.json file
-	we can difine rules in tslint.json file and validate the rules by running ng lint
	-	Find all the errors 
	
## Linting in VS code 

-	In order to use Linting in vs code we can just add TSLint extension to VSCode


##	Deployement options 

-	Github pages : No Backend

	-	Great app for only front end
	-	Back end or API needs to maintain separately
	
-	Firebase
	
	-	Firebase is cloud platform provided by google
	-	Firebase can be used to build our back end  and mobile application in very fast manner
	-	Firebase is made to fast deployment
	-	With firebase we get fast scalable realtime database and library to work in database
	-	So we dont need to build api from scratch 
	-	And this increase productivity significantly
	
	
-	Heroku

	- 	Custom back end
	-	Heroku is a cloud platform that lets you build deploy monitor and scale our application 
	
	
	
	
##	Hosting with Github pages

-	Install github pages globally using npm package manager
-	Upload all the files 
-	build the angular application with ng build --prod command
-	publish the app to Github pages using ngh command



##	Deployement to Firebase

-	Firebase provides front-end + firebase as the backend
-	We can use firebase libarary to store data and so called realtime database
-	If our application needs some kind of backend and we dont need to build that backend from scratch then firebase is good options
-	Install firebase-tools package using npm
-	login to firebase account 
	
	-	firebase init
		-	select the options
			-	database or hosting 
			-	select hosting
			-	Select the firbase project where we needs to deploy the application
				
				-	then firebase will create the two files 
					-	firebase.json
					-	.firebaserc
					
-	build the app with ng build --prod
-	firebase deploy 
-	setup rule of firebase to redirect all requests to index.html with firebase.json file
-	we can add deploy firebase command to scripts section of package.json file	

		"deploye:firebase":"ng build --prod && firebase deploy"

## Heroku 


-	Heroku is a cloud Paas that let's us to build deploy monitor and scale our apps
-	install heroku packages
-	login to heroku with : heroku login
-	create a new app with : heroky create app-name
-	heroku open : open the link on browser
