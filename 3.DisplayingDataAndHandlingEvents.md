#	Displaying Data and Handling Events

##	Data Binding

-	Server will send the html response and browser will process the html response
-	Hmtl document is a DOM tree
-	DOM is a tree structure of html elements
-	javascript can change the structure of DOM at browser

	-	Data Bindind is binding the data from DOM to Javascript
	
-	In Angualar, there are 4 types of binding
	
	-	Interpolation 
	
		-	Interpolation is done using double curly braces {{}}
		-	It's binding the data from view to view
		-	It's a one way binding
		
	-	Property Binding
		-	Property Binding is mainly used to send values of variables from parent component to property of child component
		-	Property Binding b/w parent and child component is achieved throug @Input decorator
		-	Hence the name property Binding
		-	Property Binding is done using []
		-	This can be either Component to view or view to Component
		-	syntax for property binding is [] inside html document
		-	Property binding is one-way binding
		
	-	Event Binding 
		-	Event Binding passes the value of variable to a method in the component on an event
		-	Syntax for event binding is () inside html document
		
	-	Two-Way Binding
		-	Two Binding is a combination of event and property binding
		-	It combines event binding and property binding through ngModel directive
		-	Two binding synchronizes the data b/w both component and dom
		-	In two-way binding changing value at view or component will be reflected at another side
			
			-	Two way binding is done thourgh ngModel directive
			-	syntax for two-way binding is [()]
			
			
		
## DOM

-	Dom is a model of objects or tree of objects that represents structure of document
-	Its a tree of objects in memory
-	When we are doing property binding, we are actually doing binding to attribute of DOM Object and not with html element

## HTML 

-	Is a markup language that is used to represent dom in text			
	
## One Way Binding or Property Bi

-	One way binding in angular is done through string interpolation  {{}} and property binding []
-	In One way binding, changes in component variable will be reflected in template 
-	But changes made template will not be reflected back in component




## Attributed Binding


	<input [value]="email" type="text"/>
	
	
		email:string = example@email.com


## Class Binding

			
				
			<button class="btn btn-primary" [class.active]="isActive"></button>
				
				
			isActive = true;	
				

## Style Binding
			
			<button class="btn btn-primary" [style.backgroundColor= "isActive: 'blue' : 'red'"]=> </button>	
			
			
## Event Binding


-	Event Binding is binding the event from template to Component
-	Click event on button or div 
-	We can pass the event from template to component using $event reference object 
		
			
			<div (click)=onDivClick($event)>
				<button (click)="onClick($event)"/>
			</div>
			
			onClick($event) {
				event.stopPropogation();
			
			}	
			

## Template Variable

-	Template variable is used to create a reference to DOM element so that we access the value
-	Using Template Variable we will be able to cleaner code
-	Using Template we can send the value of dom element to handerMethod on Component


##	Pipes

-	Pipes are used to transform the data 
-	Pipes are used to formate data 
-	We can also create custom pipe
