# Routing and Navigation in Angular


##	Steps to implement Routing and Navigation

-	Import and used Router Module in @NgModule
-	Configure the routes
-	Add	Router Outlet

	-	Router Outlet is the place where we will display the corresponding component when a given route becomes active
-	Add links


## Configuring Routes

-	Import Router Module in AppModule
-	Use RouterModule to define all the routes in the application	
-	Each route is object with two properties

		{ path: '',component: HomeComponenet }
		{ path: 'followers:/username', component: FollowersComponent }
		{ path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }
		
-	More specific routes should be at the top and generic should at the bottom
-	Below is the example of Sample Router configuration in Router Module class				

				
					@NgModule({
					  imports: [
						RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
						  useHash: true
						})
					  ],
					  exports: [RouterModule]
					})
					export class AppRoutingModule { }
			
			
					const routes: Routes = [
					  {
						path: "login",
						component: LoginComponent
					  },
					  {
						path: "",
						component: MainComponent,
						canActivate: [AuthGuard],
						children: [
						  {
							component: AttomComponent,
							path: "",
							resolve: {
							  profile: AttomResolveGuard
							},
							children: [
							  {
								component: NotificationComponent,
								path: "notification",
								children: [
								  {
									path: "",
									redirectTo: "all",
									pathMatch: "full"
								  },
								  {
									component: NotificationAllComponent,
									path: "all"
								  }
								]
							  }
							]
						]
					];	
					
					
##	Router Outlet

-	Router outlet is the place where angular is going to display associated component with Route
-	<router-outlet></router-outlet> 

	-	router-outlet is a directive defined in router module 
	-	when angular receives this its going to render the component associated with the current route
	-	Angular will render the current associated component after the router-outlet element not  inside the router-outlet element
	
	
	
##	 Router Link

-	Angular is used to develop single page application 
-	In Single page application a single page is downloaded from the server
-	And as user navigates from one page to another only content of target page is downloaded
-	We wont use href attribute of anchor element because 

	-	It will create a flicker effect to screen
	-	And whole angular application is reloaded, all the js files, css files will downloaded from the server
	-	This result in slowness of angular application

-	In order to avoid reloading of entire angular application
	-	We should use routerLink directive instead of href attribute of anchor tag
	
			<a routerLink="/followers" />
			<a routerLink="/posts" />
		
##	Router Link as property binding

-	RouterLink property binding is used to deal with route parameters
-	In order to router link dynamic, we need use property binding with routerLink directive
	
		<a [routerLink]="['/followers', follower.id]"/>
		
		

##	RouterLink Active

-	routerLinkActive directive is used to apply highlighter to currently selected option
-	we can also apply css classes to routerLinkActive directive when that link is active



## Getting Route Parameter or Extracting current route parameters

-	In order to retrieve the param values of route
-	We need to inject ActivatedRoute class install into constructor of component to extract the params
-	ActivatedRoute will return a observable that we need to subscribe for to extract the values


		ngOnInit() {
			
			this.activatedRoute.paramMap
				.subscribe(params => {
					params.get('username')
				});
		
		
		}


## Routes with multiple paramters


		RouterModule.forRoot([
		
			{ path: '/followers/:id/:username', component: FollowersComponent}
		
		])
		
		
		<a routerLink="['/followers',follower.id, follower.login]"

## Query Parameters

-	Query Parameters are used to send optional parameters

	
	<a [routerLink]="/followers" [queryParams]="{page : 1, order: 'newest'}">Followers</a>
	
	
-	Retrieving queryParams 

	-	this.route.queryParams.subscribe();
	-	this.route.snapshot.queryParams.get('page')
	
	
	
##	Subscribing to multiple Observables

-	We can subscribe to multiple Observables like below

			
			ngOnIni() {
			
				
				Observable.	combineLatest([
					this.route.paramMap,
					this.route.queryParamMap
						
				])
				.subscribe(combined => {
					let id = combined[0].get('id');
					let page = combined[1].get('page');
				
				});
			
			
			
			}
